	Ahmedabad is the largest city in the State of Gujarat and the Seventh- largest urban agglomeration in India, with a population of almost 74 lakhs (7.4 Million). City is Located on the banks of the River Sabarmati. The city is the administrative centre of Ahmedabad district, and was the capital of Gujarat from 1960 to 1970; the capital was shifted to Gandhinagar thereafter. The city was at the forefront of the Indian independence movement in the first half of 20th century. It was the epicentre of many campaigns of civil disobedience to promote workers’ right, civil rights and political independence. Mahatma Gandhi also established Gandhi Ashram on the bank of river Sabarmati and selected Ahmedabad as his “Karmabhumi”.

Under British rule, a military Cantonment was established and the city infrastructure was modernized and expanded. It was part of the Bombay Presidency during the British rules in India.

The city is also called Karnavati, a name for an older town that existed in the walled area.

	Ahmedabad remained the most important city in the Gujarat region. The City established itself as the home of a booming textile industry, which earned the nickname “The Manchester of India.” With the creation of the state of Gujarat in 1960, Ahmedabad gained prominence as the political and commercial capital of the state.
